# Directory and File Upload Fix

## ✅ Problem Solved

**Error**: `fopen(D:\source_code\ecom\storage\app/temp/bulk_upload_1754912269.csv): Failed to open stream: No such file or directory`

**Root Cause**: The temporary directory `storage/app/temp` didn't exist, causing the file upload to fail.

## 🔧 Solutions Implemented

### 1. Automatic Directory Creation
```php
// Ensure temp directory exists
$tempDir = storage_path('app/temp');
if (!is_dir($tempDir)) {
    mkdir($tempDir, 0755, true);
}
```

### 2. Fallback File Storage Method
```php
try {
    // Try Laravel's storage method first
    $tempPath = $file->storeAs('temp', $tempFileName, 'local');
    $fullPath = storage_path('app/' . $tempPath);
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    // Fallback: Direct file move
    $fullPath = $tempDir . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . $tempFileName;
    if (!$file->move($tempDir, $tempFileName)) {
        throw new \Exception('Failed to move uploaded file to temporary directory.');
    }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- **File existence verification** before processing
- **Comprehensive logging** for debugging
- **Proper cleanup** of temporary files
- **Detailed error messages** for troubleshooting

### 4. Improved CSV Parsing
- **File existence checks** before opening
- **Readable file verification**
- **Better error messages** for CSV issues
- **Detailed logging** of parsing process

### 5. Directory Setup Script
Created `create_upload_directories.php` to ensure all required directories exist:
```bash
php create_upload_directories.php
```

## 📁 Required Directories

The following directories are now automatically created:

```
storage/
├── app/
│   ├── temp/           # Temporary upload files
│   └── public/
│       └── products/   # Product images
└── logs/               # Log files

public/
└── storage/            # Symlink to storage/app/public
```

## 🛠 How to Fix This Issue

### Option 1: Run the Directory Setup Script
```bash
cd D:\source_code\ecom
php create_upload_directories.php
```

### Option 2: Manual Directory Creation
```bash
mkdir -p storage/app/temp
mkdir -p storage/app/public/products
chmod 755 storage/app/temp
chmod 755 storage/app/public/products
```

### Option 3: Use Laravel Artisan (if needed)
```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

## 🔍 Enhanced Debugging

### Added Comprehensive Logging:
- **File upload attempts** with file details
- **Directory creation** success/failure
- **CSV parsing progress** with row counts
- **Error details** with full stack traces
- **Cleanup operations** for temporary files

### Error Messages Now Include:
- **Exact file paths** being accessed
- **File size information**
- **Directory permissions** status
- **Specific operation** that failed

## 🎯 Testing Steps

### 1. Verify Directories Exist:
```bash
ls -la storage/app/
# Should show 'temp' directory

ls -la storage/app/temp/
# Should be empty but accessible
```

### 2. Test Upload Process:
1. Go to Admin → Products → Bulk Upload
2. Select a CSV file
3. Click "Upload Products"
4. Check for success message

### 3. Check Logs (if issues persist):
```bash
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

## 📋 What This Fixes

### ✅ Directory Issues:
- **Automatic creation** of missing directories
- **Proper permissions** (755) for upload directories
- **Fallback methods** if Laravel storage fails

### ✅ File Upload Issues:
- **Multiple storage methods** (Laravel + direct file move)
- **File existence verification** at each step
- **Proper cleanup** of temporary files

### ✅ Error Handling:
- **Detailed error messages** for troubleshooting
- **Comprehensive logging** for debugging
- **Graceful failure handling** with cleanup

### ✅ CSV Processing:
- **Enhanced file validation** before processing
- **Better error messages** for CSV format issues
- **Row-by-row processing** with error tracking

## 🚀 Result

**Before:**
```
❌ Upload failed: fopen(): Failed to open stream: No such file or directory
❌ No error details for debugging
❌ No automatic directory creation
```

**After:**
```
✅ Automatic directory creation
✅ Multiple fallback methods for file storage
✅ Comprehensive error logging
✅ Proper file cleanup
✅ Enhanced CSV processing
```
