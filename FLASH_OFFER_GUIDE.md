## Installation Steps

### 1. Run Migrations
Execute the setup batch file:

```

Or manually run:
```bash
php artisan migrate --path=database/migrations/2025_07_25_000001_add_flash_offer_fields_to_offers_table.php
php artisan migrate --path=database/migrations/2025_07_25_000002_update_offers_type_enum.php
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
```

### 2. Create Storage Directory
Ensure the storage directory for banner images exists:
```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

### 3. Service Provider Registration
The FlashOfferServiceProvider is already registered in `config/app.php` to automatically share active flash offers with all views.

## Usage Instructions

### Creating a Flash Offer

1. **Navigate to Admin Panel**
   - Go to `http://yoursite.local:8000/admin/offers`
   - Click "Create New Offer"

2. **Basic Offer Configuration**
   - Enter offer name (e.g., "Flash Weekend Sale")
   - Set discount type to "Flash Offer"
   - Configure discount percentage or amount
   - Set start and end dates

3. **Flash Offer Settings**
   - Check "Enable Flash Offer"
   - Upload banner image (recommended: 800x400px)
   - Enter banner title (e.g., "LIMITED TIME FLASH SALE!")
   - Add banner description
   - Set button text (default: "Shop Now")
   - Configure button URL (optional)
   - Set popup delay (0-60 seconds)
   - Enable countdown timer
   - Customize countdown text

4. **Save and Activate**
   - Click "Create Offer"
   - Ensure the offer is marked as "Active"

### Flash Offer Display Logic

The popup will appear when:
- The offer is active and within date range
- `is_flash_offer` is true
- `show_popup` is enabled
- User hasn't seen this specific offer popup today (localStorage)

### Customization Options

#### Popup Styling
The popup includes modern CSS with:
- Gradient backgrounds
- Glassmorphism effects
- Smooth animations
- Responsive design
- Pulse animations for countdown

#### Countdown Timer
- Automatically calculates remaining time
- Updates every second
- Hides popup when offer expires
- Shows days, hours, minutes, seconds

#### Smart Display Logic
- Uses localStorage to track viewed popups
- One popup per offer per day per user
- Respects popup delay settings
- Auto-hides on offer expiration

## File Structure

### New Files Added:
```
app/Providers/FlashOfferServiceProvider.php
resources/views/components/flash-offer-popup.blade.php
database/migrations/2025_07_25_000001_add_flash_offer_fields_to_offers_table.php
database/migrations/2025_07_25_000002_update_offers_type_enum.php
setup_flash_offers.bat
```

### Modified Files:
```
app/Models/Offer.php
app/Http/Controllers/Admin/OfferController.php
resources/views/admin/offers/create.blade.php
resources/views/admin/offers/edit.blade.php
resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php
config/app.php
```

## Testing the Flash Offer System

1. **Create a Test Flash Offer**
   - Set start date to today
   - Set end date to tomorrow
   - Upload a test banner image
   - Enable popup and countdown

2. **View on Frontend**
   - Visit `http://yoursite.local:8000`
   - Wait for popup delay
   - Popup should appear with countdown timer

3. **Test localStorage Logic**
   - Close popup
   - Refresh page - popup shouldn't appear again
   - Clear localStorage or wait until next day to see popup again

## Troubleshooting

### Popup Not Appearing
1. Check if offer is active and within date range
2. Verify `is_flash_offer` and `show_popup` are enabled
3. Clear browser localStorage for your domain
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Image Not Displaying
1. Ensure `php artisan storage:link` was run
2. Check file permissions on storage directory
3. Verify image was uploaded successfully
4. Check if image path in database is correct

### Countdown Not Working
1. Verify offer end date is in the future
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Ensure offer dates are properly formatted

## Browser Compatibility
- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Performance Considerations
- Flash offer popup is loaded only when an active flash offer exists
- Images are optimized and stored in Laravel's storage system
- JavaScript is efficiently coded to minimize impact
- LocalStorage prevents unnecessary repeated displays

## Security Notes
- All file uploads are validated for image types
- File size limited to 2MB
- XSS protection through Laravel's built-in escaping
- CSRF protection on all forms

## Support
For issues or questions about the flash offer system, refer to:
1. Laravel documentation for file uploads
2. Bootstrap documentation for modal components
3. Check browser developer tools for debugging

**Congratulations!** Your flash offer system is now ready to help boost sales with eye-catching limited-time promotions.
