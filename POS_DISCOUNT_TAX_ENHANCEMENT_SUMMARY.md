## Database Enhancements

**File:** `database/migrations/2025_07_06_000001_add_tax_fields_to_pos_sale_items.php`

Added missing fields to `pos_sale_items` table:
- `tax_percentage` - Store individual item tax percentage
- `tax_amount` - Store calculated tax amount for each item
- `company_id` - Multi-tenant support
- `discount_percentage` - Store discount percentage for reporting

### 2. Enhanced POS Sales Table
**File:** `database/migrations/2025_07_06_000002_enhance_pos_sales_table.php`

Improvements to `pos_sales` table:

## Controller Improvements

**Key Calculation Improvements:**
```php
// Before: Tax calculated on gross amount
$itemTax = ($itemSubtotal * $product->tax_percentage) / 100;

// After: Tax calculated on net amount (after discount)
$netAmount = $itemSubtotal - $discountAmount;
$itemTax = ($netAmount * $product->tax_percentage) / 100;
```
