# POS Discount & Tax Features - Quick Reference Guide

## ðŸ›’ Using Item-Level Discounts

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Add items to cart** by clicking on product cards
2. **Apply item discount:**
   - Click the **%** button next to any cart item
   - Enter discount **amount** (in â‚¹) OR **percentage** (%)
   - System automatically calculates the other value
   - Preview shows the net amount
   - Click **"Apply Discount"**

### Discount Options:
- **Amount Discount:** Enter â‚¹50 to give â‚¹50 off the item
- **Percentage Discount:** Enter 10% to give 10% off the item
- **Real-time Preview:** See net amount before applying

## ðŸ’° Tax Management

### Auto Tax Mode (Default):
- System calculates tax based on product tax percentages
- Tax applied on net amount (after item discounts)
- Shows CGST and SGST separately

### Manual Tax Mode:
1. Toggle the **"Manual"** switch next to Tax field
2. Enter custom tax amount
3. Add tax notes if needed
4. System uses your entered amount instead of auto-calculation

## ðŸ§¾ Sale-Level Discounts

### Additional Discounts:
- Use the **"Discount"** field in cart summary
- This is applied AFTER item-level discounts
- Good for customer loyalty discounts or promotional offers

## ðŸ“Š Understanding the Calculations

### Calculation Flow:
```
Item Price Ã— Quantity = Gross Amount
Gross Amount - Item Discount = Net Amount
Net Amount Ã— Tax% = Tax Amount
Net Amount + Tax - Sale Discount = Final Amount
```

### Example:
```
Product: â‚¹100 Ã— 2 = â‚¹200 (Gross)
Item Discount: â‚¹20 = â‚¹180 (Net)
Tax (18%): â‚¹32.40 = â‚¹212.40 (With Tax)
Sale Discount: â‚¹10 = â‚¹202.40 (Final)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices

### For Item Discounts:
- Use **percentage discounts** for promotional offers (10% off)
- Use **amount discounts** for fixed reductions (â‚¹50 off)
- Apply to individual items for specific product promotions

### For Sale Discounts:

### For Tax Management:
