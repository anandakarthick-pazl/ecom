## 📈 Performance Considerations

- Indexed columns for fast searches

### Frontend Performance
- Lazy loading of commission details
- Efficient DOM manipulation for bulk selections
- Minimal JavaScript dependencies
- Responsive design for mobile devices

### Bulk Operation Limits
- Recommended maximum: 100 commissions per bulk operation
- Progress feedback for large batches
- Error handling for timeout scenarios
- Memory-efficient processing

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Custom Status Workflows
The system supports extending status workflows:
```php
// Add custom status transitions
$commission->update(['status' => 'custom_status']);

// Add custom validation rules
if (!$commission->canBeCustomProcessed()) {
    return response()->json(['error' => 'Custom processing not allowed']);
}
```

### Integration with External Systems
```php
// Webhook notifications for status changes
Commission::observe(CommissionObserver::class);

// API endpoints for external integration
Route::post('/api/commissions/{id}/update-status', [ApiController::class, 'updateStatus']);
```

### Reporting and Analytics
```php
// Custom commission reports
$monthlyStats = Commission::getMonthlyAnalytics();
$topPerformers = Commission::getTopPerformers(10);
$pendingByAge = Commission::getPendingByAge();
```
