# WhatsApp Message Template Fix - Variables Not Replacing

## Issue Resolved
WhatsApp messages were showing placeholder variables like `{{ customer_name }}`, `{{ order_number }}`, etc. instead of actual customer and order data.

## Root Cause
The OrderController was calling `getOrderStatusMessage()` and `replaceMessagePlaceholders()` methods that **didn't exist**, causing the placeholder replacement to fail completely.

## Files Updated

### 1. OrderController.php ✅
**Added Missing Methods:**

#### `getOrderStatusMessage($order, $oldStatus, $newStatus)`
- Retrieves WhatsApp templates from app settings for each order status
- Supports: pending, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled
- Falls back to default templates if custom ones aren't configured
- Calls `replaceMessagePlaceholders()` to substitute variables

#### `getPaymentStatusMessage($order, $oldPaymentStatus, $newPaymentStatus)`
- Handles payment confirmation WhatsApp messages
- Uses custom template from settings or default template
- Replaces all placeholders with actual data

#### `replaceMessagePlaceholders($template, $order)`
- **Core method** that replaces all `{{ variable }}` placeholders
- Supports comprehensive set of variables (see below)
- Includes proper error handling and logging
- Loads company relationship if needed

#### `testWhatsAppMessage($order)` (Debug Method)
- Test endpoint to verify template replacement works
- Returns formatted messages for inspection
- Useful for debugging template issues

### 2. Order.php ✅
**Added Company Relationship:**
```php
public function company()
{
    return $this->belongsTo(\App\Models\SuperAdmin\Company::class, 'company_id');
}
```

### 3. TwilioWhatsAppService.php ✅
**Updated prepareMessage() method:**
- Marked as deprecated for order status messages
- Now only used for bill PDF messages
- Uses simple template with proper placeholder replacement

## Supported WhatsApp Template Variables

### Core Variables
- `{{customer_name}}` - Customer's full name
- `{{order_number}}` - Unique order identifier
- `{{total}}` - Order total amount (formatted)

```

Visit: `https://test.pazl.info/admin/orders/{order_id}/test-whatsapp-message`

### 3. Test Real WhatsApp Sending
1. Go to order details page: `https://test.pazl.info/admin/orders/31`
2. Change order status from current to "Shipped"
3. Check WhatsApp message received
4. Variables should now show actual values instead of `{{ variable }}`

### 4. Test Payment Status Update

## Custom Template Configuration

Templates can be customized via AppSetting with these keys:
- `whatsapp_template_pending`
- `whatsapp_template_processing`
- `whatsapp_template_shipped`
- `whatsapp_template_delivered`
- `whatsapp_template_cancelled`
- `whatsapp_template_payment_confirmed`

## Troubleshooting

### If Variables Still Not Replacing:

1. **Check Company Relationship**
   ```php
   $order = Order::with('company')->find(31);
   dd($order->company); // Should not be null
   ```

2. **Check Debug Logs**
   Look for entries in `storage/logs/laravel.log`:
   - "WhatsApp message placeholder replacement"
   - "WhatsApp message after replacement"

3. **Test Template Method Directly**
   ```php
   $order = Order::find(31);
   $controller = new OrderController();
   $message = $controller->testWhatsAppMessage(request(), $order);
   ```

4. **Verify App Settings**
   Check if custom templates are properly saved in app_settings table

### Common Issues:
- **Company relationship not loaded**: Added explicit company() relationship
- **Missing methods**: All required methods now implemented
- **Template not found**: Default templates provided as fallback
- **Placeholder format**: Uses `{{ variable }}` format consistently

## What This Fix Provides

✅ **Complete placeholder replacement system**  
✅ **All order and customer data variables**  
✅ **Customizable templates via admin settings**  
✅ **Proper error handling and logging**  
✅ **Debug methods for troubleshooting**  
✅ **Backward compatibility maintained**  
✅ **Comprehensive variable support**  

The WhatsApp messages will now display actual customer names, order numbers, amounts, and company information instead of placeholder variables.
