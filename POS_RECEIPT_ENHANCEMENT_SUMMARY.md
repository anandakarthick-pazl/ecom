$itemTax = ($itemNet * $item->tax_percentage) / 100;
$itemTotal = $itemNet + $itemTax;
```

```php
// Overall Totals
$itemsSubtotal = $sale->items->sum(function($item) {
    return $item->quantity * $item->unit_price;
});
$totalItemDiscounts = $sale->items->sum('discount_amount');
$netAfterItemDiscounts = $itemsSubtotal - $totalItemDiscounts;
