# âœ… Laravel 500 Error - FIXED!

## ðŸš¨ **Issue Identified & Resolved**

The 500 internal server error was caused by **cached view files** referencing a non-existent partial view `partials.product-card-compact`.

## ðŸ”§ **What Was Fixed**

### 1. **Root Cause**
- The application was using `home-enhanced.blade.php` (not `home.blade.php`)
- This file contained references to `@include('partials.product-card-compact', ...)` 
- The `product-card-compact` partial didn't exist, causing the error

### 2. **Files Updated**
- âœ… `resources/views/home-enhanced.blade.php` - Fixed all product card includes

- âœ… `resources/views/partials/product-card-modern.blade.php` - Updated image sizes
- âœ… `resources/views/admin/products/index.blade.php` - Updated admin grid

### 3. **Changes Made**
All references changed from:
```php
@include('partials.product-card-compact', [...])
```
To:
```php
@include('partials.product-card-modern', [...])
```

### 4. **Size Reductions Applied**
