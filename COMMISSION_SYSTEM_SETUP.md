# Commission System Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview
The commission system has been successfully implemented to capture commission percentage and reference name when placing orders in both **POS** and **Online Order** systems. Commission records are stored in a separate table and can be managed through the admin panel.

## 📋 What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Database Structure
- ✅ **Commission Table**: Already exists with all necessary fields
- ✅ **Order Table**: Commission fields added (`commission_enabled`, `reference_name`, `commission_percentage`, `commission_notes`)
- ✅ **Migration**: Created to add commission fields to orders table

### 2. Models Updated
- ✅ **Order Model**: Added commission fields, relationships, and methods
- ✅ **Commission Model**: Already exists with full functionality
- ✅ **Relationships**: Both models have proper relationships

### 3. Controllers
- ✅ **PosController**: Commission capture already implemented
- ✅ **CheckoutController**: Commission fields added for online orders
- ✅ **CommissionController**: Full CRUD operations for commission management
- ✅ **Order creation**: Commission records auto-created when enabled

### 4. Views
- ✅ **POS System**: Commission section already exists in checkout modal
- ✅ **Online Checkout**: Commission section added to checkout form
- ✅ **Admin Order View**: Commission information display added
- ✅ **Commission Management**: Complete admin interface for managing commissions

### 5. Routes
- ✅ **Commission Routes**: Added to admin routes for full management
- ✅ **API Endpoints**: For commission analytics and exports

## 🚀 Quick Setup Steps
