# LOGIN ISSUE RESOLUTION GUIDE

## Issue Identified
The login form at `http://greenvalleyherbs.local:8000/login` was redirecting back to the login page due to:

1. **Route Name Mismatch**: The form was posting to `route('login.post')` but the actual route was named `login.enhanced`
2. **Missing Company/User Data**: The domain might not have a corresponding company record or admin users

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Route Configuration Fixed
- **File**: `routes/auth.php`
- **Change**: Renamed the login POST route from `login.enhanced` to `login.post` to match the form action
- **Forms Updated**: All login forms now correctly post to the working route

### 2. Enhanced Error Logging
- **File**: `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/EnhancedAuthController.php`
- **Improvement**: Added detailed logging to track login attempts and identify issues

### 3. Debug Tools Added
- **File**: `setup_test_login.php` - Run with `php artisan tinker` to check/create test data
- **Route**: `/debug/domain-check` - Visit this URL to see domain and company setup status
- **File**: `debug_login.php` - Additional debugging script

### 4. Forgot Password Integration
- Updated all login forms to include proper forgot password links
- Added forgot password functionality for both regular and admin users

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Check Domain and Company Setup
Visit: `http://greenvalleyherbs.local:8000/debug/domain-check`

This will show:
- If the company exists for the domain
- Available admin users
- Super admin users

### Step 2: Create Test Data (if needed)
If no company or users exist, run:
```bash
php artisan tinker
```
Then paste the contents of `setup_test_login.php`

### Step 3: Test Login
Try logging in with:
- **URL**: `http://greenvalleyherbs.local:8000/login`
- **Email**: `admin@greenvalleyherbs.com`
- **Password**: `password123`

## Database Requirements

### Company Record
The database should have a company record with:
```sql
domain = 'greenvalleyherbs.local:8000'
status = 'active'
```

### Admin User
The database should have a user record with:
```sql
company_id = [company_id_from_above]
role = 'admin' OR 'manager'
status = 'active'
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Company not found for domain"
**Solution**: Run the setup script to create the company record

### Issue: "Access denied to this company"
**Solution**: Ensure user's `company_id` matches the company record's `id`

### Issue: "Insufficient privileges for admin access"
**Solution**: Ensure user's `role` is 'admin' or 'manager'

### Issue: Still redirecting to login
**Causes**:
1. Session configuration issues
2. Middleware blocking access
3. Route caching

**Solutions**:
1. Clear route cache: `php artisan route:clear`
2. Clear config cache: `php artisan config:clear`
3. Clear session data: `php artisan session:flush`

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Company exists with correct domain
- [ ] Admin user exists with correct company_id and role
- [ ] Login form posts to correct route
- [ ] Session configuration is working
- [ ] No route caching conflicts

## Emergency Access

If all else fails, create a super admin user:
```php
\App\Models\User::create([
    'name' => 'Emergency Admin',
    'email' => 'emergency@admin.com',
    'password' => bcrypt('emergency123'),
    'is_super_admin' => true,
    'role' => 'super_admin',
    'status' => 'active'
]);
```

Super admins can access any domain and company.
